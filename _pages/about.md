I am a Data Engineer by [eWolff in the Dr. Wolff group](https://www.drwolffgroup.com/). There I work together with different teams to acquire and prepare the data for analyses. On a given day I may be discussing about structuring data from and for different stakeholders, developing automatic pipeline for extracting and loading data, coordinating different tasks, transforming the data, or exploring the data in order to gain an understanding in their relationship.

On the data/programing related side, I play with data questioning different habits, reasoning, or playing with different creative or analytic pipeline.

Beside, I am a fervant bike rider and like training for dancing shows.
